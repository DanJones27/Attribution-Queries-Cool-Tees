# Attribution-Queries-Cool-Tees


This project is on a company called 'Cool T-shirts'. CTS started a few marketing campaigns to increase website visits 
and purchases. Using touch attribution, they’d like to map their customers’ journey: from initial visit to purchase.
These are the questions below they wanted answering.

1.
How many campaigns and sources does CoolTShirts use? Which source is used for each campaign?


2.
What pages are on the CoolTShirts website?

What is the user journey?


3.
How many first touches is each campaign responsible for?


4.
How many last touches is each campaign responsible for?



5.
How many visitors make a purchase?

Count the distinct users who visited the page named 4 - purchase.



6.
How many last touches on the purchase page is each campaign responsible for?


7.
CoolTShirts can re-invest in 5 campaigns. Given your findings in the project, which should they pick and why?
